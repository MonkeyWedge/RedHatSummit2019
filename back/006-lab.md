* Download a copy of the blueprint configuration file from Image Builder

  ~~~
[root@bastion-GUID ~]# composer-cli blueprints save test-blueprint-1
~~~
* You will get a file **test-blueprint-1.toml**

* Append the following lines to the test-blueprint-1.toml file
~~~
[[customizations.user]]
name = "myuser"
password = “mypassword”
groups = ["users", "wheel"]
~~~

* Push the revised blueprint configuration file back to Image Builder
