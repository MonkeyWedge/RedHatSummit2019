# Lab 1.1 - Install Image Builder

* Install Image Builder with the CLI and the web console plugin:
~~~
[root@bastion-GUID ~]# yum install lorax lorax-composer composer-cli cockpit-composer
~~~

* Enable and start composer service
~~~
[root@bastion-GUID ~]# systemctl enable --now lorax-composer.socket
~~~

* Restart cockpit service to load newly installed plugin
~~~
[root@bastion-GUID ~]# systemctl restart cockpit.service
~~~

  > #### Note::
>
> Restarting the web console will log you out, you need to relogin

* Now you should be able to see the "Image Builder" tab on left hand side of the Web Console.
